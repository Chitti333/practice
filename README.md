## **What is Git?**

Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It allows multiple developers to work on a project concurrently without overwriting each other’s work.

---

## **Why Use Git?**
- **Collaboration**: Git allows multiple developers to contribute to the same project.
- **Version Control**: Easily manage versions of your project, and revert to previous versions if needed.
- **Branching and Merging**: Create independent lines of development (branches) and merge them when ready.
- **Backup**: Distributed nature ensures a copy of the project is always available.

---

## **Version Control Systems**
Git is a version control system, but others include:
- **Subversion (SVN)**
- **Mercurial**
- **Perforce**

Version control keeps track of changes to files and allows for collaboration between multiple contributors.

---

## **Supported Operating Systems**
Git can be used on:
- **Linux**
- **macOS**
- **Windows** (via Git Bash or Git for Windows)

---

## **Git Commands**

### **Git Initialization & Configuration**

1. **`git init`**  
   Initializes a new Git repository.
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. **`git config`**  
   Configures your Git settings (e.g., username and email).
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
   ```

3. **`git config --list`**  
   Lists all the current configuration settings.
   ```bash
   git config --list
   ```

### **Working with Git**

4. **`git add`**  
   Stages files to be committed.
   ```bash
   git add <file-name>
   git add .
   ```

5. **`git commit`**  
   Commits staged changes.
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Commit message"
   ```

6. **`git status`**  
   Shows the status of your working directory and staged files.
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

7. **`git log`**  
   Displays the commit history.
   ```bash
   git log
   ```

8. **`git diff`**  
   Shows the difference between files in the working directory.
   ```bash
   git diff
   ```

9. **`git reset`**  
   Unstages or resets changes.
   ```bash
   git reset HEAD <file>
   git reset --hard <commit-hash>
   ```

10. **`git stash`**  
    Temporarily stores changes that are not ready to commit.
    ```bash
    git stash
    ```

11. **`git stash pop`**  
    Applies the stashed changes back to the working directory.
    ```bash
    git stash pop
    ```

---

### **Branching & Merging**

12. **`git branch`**  
    Lists, creates, or deletes branches.
    ```bash
    git branch          # List all branches
    git branch new-branch  # Create a new branch
    ```

13. **`git checkout`**  
    Switches to another branch or a specific commit.
    ```bash
    git checkout <branch-name>
    git checkout -b <new-branch>  # Create and switch to a new branch
    ```

14. **`git merge`**  
    Merges another branch into the current branch.
    ```bash
    git merge <branch-name>
    ```

15. **`git rebase`**  
    Reapplies commits on top of another base tip.
    ```bash
    git rebase <branch-name>
    ```

---

### **Git Remotes**

16. **`git remote add`**  
    Adds a new remote repository.
    ```bash
    git remote add origin <repository-url>
    ```

17. **`git remote -v`**  
    Lists all remotes associated with the repository.
    ```bash
    git remote -v
    ```

18. **`git push`**  
    Pushes local commits to the remote repository.
    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

19. **`git pull`**  
    Fetches and merges changes from the remote repository.
    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    ```

---

### **Undoing Changes**

20. **`git revert`**  
    Reverts a specific commit, creating a new commit that undoes the changes.
    ```bash
    git revert <commit-hash>
    ```

21. **`git reset`**  
    Resets the current branch to a specific state.
    ```bash
    git reset --hard <commit-hash>
    ```

---

## **GitHub Workflow**

### **Creating a GitHub Repository**

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and log in.
2. Click on **New Repository**.
3. Name your repository and choose whether it’s public or private.
4. Optionally, add a **README.md** file.
5. Create the repository.

### **Cloning a Repository**
To clone a repository from GitHub:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/repository.git
```

### **Pushing to GitHub**
1. Add a remote repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repository.git
   ```
2. Push changes:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### **Pull Requests**
- A **Pull Request** is a way to propose changes to a repository.
- Create a pull request by navigating to the repository on GitHub and selecting the **Pull Requests** tab.
- Compare your branch to the base branch and create the pull request.

---

## **Example Project**

Here’s an example of how Git might be used in a project:

1. **Initialize the project**:
   ```bash
   mkdir example-project
   cd example-project
   git init
   ```

2. **Create and commit files**:
   ```bash
   echo "# Example Project" > README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Initial commit with README"
   ```

3. **Create a branch for new features**:
   ```bash
   git branch new-feature
   git checkout new-feature
   ```

4. **Make changes and commit**:
   ```bash
   echo "New feature content" > feature.txt
   git add feature.txt
   git commit -m "Added new feature"
   ```

5. **Merge the branch back into main**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge new-feature
   ```

6. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/user/example-project.git
   git push origin main
   ```
